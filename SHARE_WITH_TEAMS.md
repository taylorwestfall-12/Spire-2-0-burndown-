## 🤖 How It Works

When they load `CREATE_BURNDOWN_DASHBOARD.md` into Claude Code:

1. **Claude reads the file** - Gets context on what to build
2. **Claude reads DASHBOARD_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Gets instructions on how to walk them through setup
3. **Claude asks questions** - Collects their ClickUp data, milestone dates, branding, etc.
4. **Claude generates everything** - Python scripts, GitHub Actions, HTML dashboard, documentation
5. **Claude sets up automation** - Configures GitHub for auto-updates and deployment
6. **Done!** - They have a working dashboard

**Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Technical knowledge required**: None (Claude handles everything)

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### Release Team
"We're shipping 3.0.0 in August and need to track bug burndown vs our Code Freeze on Aug 15."

### Product Team
"We have a Q3 release with 200 bugs. We need projections to see if we'll hit our deadline."

Subject: Create Your Own Bug Burndown Dashboard in 15 Minutes

Hi [Team],

I built an automated bug burndown dashboard for our Spire 2.0.0 release and 
wanted to share the tool so you can create one for your release too.

It takes about 15 minutes to set up and then updates itself 3x daily. Zero 
maintenance required.

To get started:
1. Download this file: [link to CREATE_BURNDOWN_DASHBOARD.md]
2. Put it in a new project folder
3. Open the folder in Claude Code
4. Tell Claude: "Help me create a bug burndown dashboard"

Claude will walk you through the entire setup - you just need your ClickUp 
API token and milestone dates.
