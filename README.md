Interactive bug burndown projection dashboard for the Spire 2.0.0 Global release.

**👋 Setting up for the first time?** Start with [GET_STARTED.md](GET_STARTED.md) - Load this file in Claude Code and Claude will clone and set up everything for you!

**👋 Already cloned?** Open [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) in Claude Code for complete project documentation and guidance!

## 📊 Live Dashboard

**🔗 https://taylorwestfall-12.github.io/Spire-2-0-burndown-/**

View the interactive dashboard with real-time bug projections, weekend plateaus, and milestone tracking.

## 🎯 What It Shows

- **Ideal Line** (Black): Required burn rate to hit zero bugs by Code Freeze (June 2, 2026)
- **Estimated Line** (Orange): Projected trajectory based on historical or recent performance
- **Actual Line** (Green): Real daily bug counts from ClickUp

### Key Features

- Weekend plateaus (no progress on Sat/Sun)
- Auto-switching rate calculation (historical → last 10 business days)
- Milestone markers for Code Freeze, Submit, and Go Live
- Real-time metrics: Active bugs, required rate, velocity gap

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automated Updates (3x Daily)

The dashboard **automatically updates** via GitHub Actions at:
- **7:00 AM PT** - Morning update before standup
- **12:00 PM PT** - Midday check-in
- **4:00 PM PT** - End-of-day snapshot

Each run:
1. Counts current active 2.0.0 bugs
2. Updates actual line with today's count
3. Recalculates projections
4. Regenerates dashboard + Slack content
5. Auto-commits and pushes to GitHub
6. GitHub Pages deploys in 1-2 minutes

**No manual intervention required!** The dashboard stays current throughout the workday.

### Manual Process

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches bug data from ClickUp
2. **Rate Calculation**: Analyzes historical performance (6-month window)
3. **Projection**: Generates three projection lines with weekend awareness
4. **Dashboard**: Creates interactive Plotly chart with Twilight Towers branding
