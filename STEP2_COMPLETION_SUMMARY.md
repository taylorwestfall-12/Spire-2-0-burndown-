## 🎯 Objectives Completed

Step 2 focused on parsing dates, mapping milestones, and preparing data for burndown analysis. All objectives have been successfully completed.

### ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Extract 2.0.0 Global milestone dates from Release Calendar**
   - Accessed Google Sheets via Google Workspace MCP
   - Located Release Calendar sheet
   - Identified 2.0.0 Global = "Client 8" in Release Calendar
   - Extracted all key dates

2. **Map ClickUp milestone names to Release Calendar**
   - Created comprehensive milestone name mapping
   - Mapped 63 ClickUp "Spire Release" field values to calendar dates
   - Handled naming discrepancies (e.g., "2.0.0 Global" vs "Client 8")

3. **Parse bug dates and filter to last 6 months**
   - Created `parse_and_map_milestones.py` script
   - Parsed all 1,915 bugs from `spire_bugs_complete.json`
   - Converted ClickUp timestamps (ms) to readable dates
   - Filtered to 6-month window (Nov 21, 2025 - May 21, 2026)
   - Result: **1,902 bugs in analysis window**

4. **Create milestone-to-date mapping file**
   - Generated `milestone_dates_2.0.0.json` with key dates
   - Generated `burndown_data.json` with complete metrics

5. **Generate Interactive Dashboard**
   - Created `generate_dashboard.py` using Plotly
   - Generated `spire_2_0_burndown_dashboard.html`
   - Interactive HTML dashboard with visualizations
