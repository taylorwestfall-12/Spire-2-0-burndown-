# Welcome to the Spire 2.0.0 Bug Burndown Dashboard!

You've been handed off ownership of this dashboard. **Don't worry** - it's designed to be low-maintenance and Claude is here to help you every step of the way.

---

## 🎯 What You Just Inherited

An **automated bug tracking dashboard** that updates itself 3 times a day and deploys to GitHub Pages. It tracks Spire 2.0.0 Global release bugs with visual projections showing whether the team is on track to hit zero bugs by Code Freeze.

**Live Dashboard**: https://taylorwestfall-12.github.io/Spire-2-0-burndown-/

**How much work is this?**
- **Daily**: Nothing! It's fully automated.
- **Weekly**: ~5 minutes to verify it's working correctly.
- **Monthly**: ~15 minutes to review trends and data quality.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taylorwestfall-12/Spire-2-0-burndown-.git
cd Spire-2-0-burndown-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Or just ask Claude:**
> "Set up this dashboard for me"

### Step 2: View the Dashboard (5 min)

1. **Online**: https://taylorwestfall-12.github.io/Spire-2-0-burndown-/
2. **Locally**: 
   ```bash
   python generate_burndown_projection_chart.py
   # Open spire_2_0_projection_dashboard.html
   ```

**Or ask Claude:**
> "Show me the dashboard"

### Step 3: Verify Automation (5 min)

Check that automatic updates are running:
- Visit: https://github.com/taylorwestfall-12/Spire-2-0-burndown-/actions
- Look for ✅ green checkmarks (recent runs)

**Or ask Claude:**

## ✅ How to Know You're Doing It Right

**After your first week, you should be able to:**
1. View the live dashboard and understand what the 3 lines mean
2. Check if automated updates are running (GitHub Actions tab)
3. Manually regenerate the dashboard if needed
4. Ask Claude for help when something's unclear

**That's it!** You don't need to understand Python, GitHub Actions, or Plotly. Claude knows all that.

---

## 🆘 When You Need Help

**First, ask Claude** (seriously, Claude is faster than Googling):
> "I'm stuck on [X], help me"
> "This error appeared: [paste error]"
> "Walk me through [task]"

**If Claude can't solve it:**
1. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - covers 90% of issues
2. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
3. Contact the previous owner (if available)

**Emergency fallback** (if dashboard is broken and you can't fix it):
```bash
# Disable automation (stop it from breaking repeatedly)
# Go to: Settings → Actions → General → "Disable Actions"

# Update manually once while you debug
python update_today_burndown.py
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **The dashboard updates itself** - You almost never need to run scripts manually
2. **Weekend plateaus are normal** - Lines stay flat Sat/Sun (no work expected)
3. **Bugs marked "WON'T FIX" don't count** - They're excluded from active counts
4. **GitHub Pages takes 1-2 min to deploy** - Be patient after pushing
5. **Claude has full project context** - Seriously, just ask Claude anything

## 🎯 Your Mission

**Keep the dashboard running** so the team can track bug progress toward Code Freeze.

- If it's working (updates 3x daily, shows current data) → You're doing great!
- If it breaks → Ask Claude to help you fix it
- If you want to change something → Ask Claude how to do it

**Remember**: This dashboard was designed to be low-maintenance. You shouldn't be spending hours on this. If you are, ask Claude: "This is taking too long, help me simplify it."
