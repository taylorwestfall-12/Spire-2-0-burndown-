# Create Your Own Bug Burndown Dashboard

**This file will guide you through creating an automated bug burndown dashboard for your release.**

Claude will walk you through collecting your data, customizing the dashboard, and setting up automation. **You don't need to know Python, Git, or GitHub Actions** - Claude handles all the technical details.

## 🎯 What You'll Get

An automated dashboard that:
- **Tracks bugs** for your release milestone from ClickUp
- **Projects completion** with 3 lines: Ideal (target), Estimated (realistic), Actual (current)
- **Updates automatically** 3 times a day via GitHub Actions
- **Deploys to GitHub Pages** for easy sharing with your team
- **Shows weekend plateaus** (realistic - no work on Sat/Sun)
- **Calculates rates** automatically from historical data

**Maintenance**: ~5 minutes per week to verify it's working.

## 📋 What Claude Needs From You

Before starting, gather this information:

### 1. ClickUp Information
- [ ] **ClickUp API Token** - Get from: ClickUp → Settings → Apps → Generate API Token
- [ ] **Team/Workspace ID** - Your ClickUp team (e.g., "12345678")
- [ ] **Space ID** (optional) - If bugs are in a specific space
- [ ] **Folder ID** (optional) - If bugs are in a specific folder
- [ ] **List ID** (optional) - If bugs are in a specific list

**Don't know your IDs?** Claude can help you find them using your API token.

### 2. Release Information

- [ ] **Submit date** - When you submit to app stores/QA (optional)
- [ ] **Go Live date** - When the release ships to production

### 3. Bug Status Mapping
- [ ] **Active statuses** - Which statuses count as "active" bugs? (e.g., "Open", "In Progress", "Ready for QA")
- [ ] **Excluded statuses** - Which statuses to ignore? (e.g., "Closed", "Won't Fix", "Duplicate")

### 4. Branding (Optional)
- [ ] **Team/Company name** - For the dashboard title
- [ ] **Logo file** - Path to your logo image (optional)
- [ ] **Color scheme** - Primary and accent colors (optional, defaults provided)

### 5. GitHub Setup

## 🚀 Let's Build Your Dashboard

Once you have the information above, tell Claude:

> "I want to create a bug burndown dashboard for my release"

Claude will ask you questions to gather the details, then:
1. **Fetch your bug data** from ClickUp
2. **Calculate historical rates** from past releases (if available)
3. **Generate Python scripts** customized for your project
4. **Create the dashboard HTML** with your branding
5. **Set up GitHub Actions** for automatic updates
6. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
7. **Generate Slack content** (optional)

**Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes

---

## 📊 Example: What Claude Will Ask

Here's a preview of the interactive setup:

```
Claude: "What's your ClickUp API token? I'll need this to fetch bug data."
You: [paste token]

Claude: "What's the milestone name in ClickUp for this release?"
You: "3.0.0 Global"

Claude: "When is Code Freeze?"
You: "2026-08-15"

Claude: "When is Go Live?"
You: "2026-09-01"

Claude: "Which bug statuses should count as 'active'?"
You: "Open, In Progress, Ready for QA, In QA"

Claude: "Which statuses should be excluded?"
You: "Closed, Won't Fix, Duplicate, Deferred"

Claude: "Great! I'll fetch your bugs and build the dashboard. This will take about 30 seconds..."
```

Claude will then generate all the files and explain what each one does.
